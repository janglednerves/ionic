/**
 * @name NavController
 * @description
 * _For examples on the basic usage of NavController, check out the
 * [Navigation section](../../../../components/#navigation) of the Component
 * docs._
 *
 * NavController is the base class for navigation controller components like
 * [`Nav`](../Nav/) and [`Tab`](../../Tabs/Tab/). You use navigation controllers
 * to navigate to [pages](#creating_pages) in your app. At a basic level, a
 * navigation controller is an array of pages representing a particular history
 * (of a Tab for example). This array can be manipulated to navigate throughout
 * an app by pushing and popping pages or inserting and removing them at
 * arbitrary locations in history.
 *
 * The current page is the last one in the array, or the top of the stack if we
 * think of it that way.  [Pushing](#push) a new page onto the top of the
 * navigation stack causes the new page to be animated in, while [popping](#pop)
 * the current page will navigate to the previous page in the stack.
 *
 * Unless you are using a directive like [NavPush](../NavPush/), or need a
 * specific NavController, most times you will inject and use a reference to the
 * nearest NavController to manipulate the navigation stack.
 *
 * ### Injecting NavController
 * Injecting NavController will always get you an instance of the nearest
 * NavController, regardless of whether it is a Tab or a Nav.
 *
 * Behind the scenes, when Ionic instantiates a new NavController, it creates an
 * injector with NavController bound to that instance (usually either a Nav or
 * Tab) and adds the injector to its own providers.  For more information on
 * providers and dependency injection, see [Providers and DI]().
 *
 * Instead, you can inject NavController and know that it is the correct
 * navigation controller for most situations (for more advanced situations, see
 * [Menu](../../Menu/Menu/) and [Tab](../../Tab/Tab/)).
 *
 * ```ts
 *  class MyComponent {
 *    constructor(private nav: NavController) {
 *
 *    }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 *
 * ## Page creation
 * Pages are created when they are added to the navigation stack.  For methods
 * like [push()](#push), the NavController takes any component class that is
 * decorated with `@Component` as its first argument.  The NavController then
 * compiles that component, adds it to the app and animates it into view.
 *
 * By default, pages are cached and left in the DOM if they are navigated away
 * from but still in the navigation stack (the exiting page on a `push()` for
 * example).  They are destroyed when removed from the navigation stack (on
 * [pop()](#pop) or [setRoot()](#setRoot)).
 *
 *
 * ## Lifecycle events
 * Lifecycle events are fired during various stages of navigation.  They can be
 * defined in any component type which is pushed/popped from a `NavController`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {Component } from '@angular/core';
 *
 * @Component({
 *   template: 'Hello World'
 * })
 * class HelloWorld {
 *   ionViewLoaded() {
 *     console.log("I'm alive!");
 *   }
 *   ionViewWillLeave() {
 *     console.log("Looks like I'm about to leave :(");
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 *  | Page Event          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
 *  |---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 *  | `ionViewLoaded`     | Runs when the page has loaded. This event only happens once per page being created and added to the DOM. If a page leaves but is cached, then this event will not fire again on a subsequent viewing. The `ionViewLoaded` event is good place to put your setup code for the page. |
 *  | `ionViewWillEnter`  | Runs when the page is about to enter and become the active page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
 *  | `ionViewDidEnter`   | Runs when the page has fully entered and is now the active page. This event will fire, whether it was the first load or a cached page.                                                                                                                                             |
 *  | `ionViewWillLeave`  | Runs when the page is about to leave and no longer be the active page.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
 *  | `ionViewDidLeave`   | Runs when the page has finished leaving and is no longer the active page.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
 *  | `ionViewWillUnload` | Runs when the page is about to be destroyed and have its elements removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
 *  | `ionViewDidUnload`  | Runs after the page has been destroyed and its elements have been removed.
 *
 *
 * ## Nav Transition Promises
 *
 * Navigation transitions are asynchronous, meaning they take a few moments to finish, and
 * the duration of a transition could be any number. In most cases the async nature of a
 * transition doesn't cause any problems and the nav controller is pretty good about handling
 * which transition was the most recent when multiple transitions have been kicked off.
 * However, when an app begins firing off many transitions, on the same stack at
 * *roughly* the same time, the nav controller can start to get lost as to which transition
 * should be finishing, and which transitions should not be animated.
 *
 * In cases where an app's navigation can be altered by other async tasks, which may or
 * may not take a long time, it's best to rely on each nav transition's returned
 * promise. So instead of firing and forgetting multiple `push` or `pop` nav transitions,
 * it's better to fire the next nav transition when the previous one has finished.
 *
 * In the example below, after the async operation has completed, we then want to transition
 * to another page. Where the potential problem comes in, is that if the async operation
 * completed 100ms after the first transition started, then kicking off another transition
 * halfway through the first transition ends up with a janky animation. Instead, it's best
 * to always ensure the first transition has already finished before starting the next.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // begin the first transition
 * let navTransition = this.nav.push(SomePage);
 *
 * // start an async call, we're not sure how long it'll take
 * someAsyncOperation().then(() => {
 *   // incase the async operation completed faster than the time
 *   // it took to finish the first transition, this logic should
 *   // always ensure that the previous transition has resolved
 *   // first before kicking off the next transition
 *   navTransition.then(() => {
 *     this.nav.push(AnotherPage);
 *   });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## NavOptions
 *
 * Some methods on `NavController` allow for customizing the current transition.
 * To do this, we can pass an object with the modified properites.
 *
 * | Property  | Value     | Description                                                                                                |
 * |-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | animate   | `boolean` | Whether or not the transition should animate.                                                              |
 * | animation | `string`  | What kind of animation should be used.                                                                     |
 * | direction | `string`  | The conceptual direction the user is navigating. For example, is the user navigating `forward`, or `back`? |
 * | duration  | `number`  | The length in milliseconds the animation should take.                                                      |
 * | easing    | `string`  | The easing for the animation.                                                                              |
 *
 * The property 'animation' understands the following values: `md-transition`, `ios-transition` and `wp-transition`.
